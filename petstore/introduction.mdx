## What is Zillabase?

ZillaBase is a high-performance database that works with Apache Kafka to store and process real-time data streams. It's designed for fast, scalable, and reliable data handling, making it perfect for applications like real-time analytics, IoT, and event-driven systems. By combining Kafka's event-streaming with queryable storage, ZillaBase helps developers build responsive and robust solutions.
